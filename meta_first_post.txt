Obligatory meta post

Not that it should matter, but this blog is running under Bryar.

A friend of mine suggested I get to the blogging again, presumably
rather than just unloading my brain in his direction.  Eventually I buckled
and installed wordpress because the last thing I needed was the effort or
or distraction of maintaining a blogging platform to suck the time up.

Then I upgraded my box from etch to lenny, and the php4-mysql package got
conflicted out taking wordpress down with it before I even got going
with (the upgrade ate my homework).

So of course, I decided to install something that'd cope with flat files
at the backend, maybe be written in perl
but still nothing I had to write or understand that much to use.  Guess what,
that didn't go well either.  Burned about a week of time, and about two weeks
of good intentions in trying to make Angerwhale install.

Going back to my friend with my tale of woe he just suggested bloxsom, which
rang bells, not least because I remembered that Simon had written Bryar
as a more modular replacement.

It installed quickly and cleanly.

It worked.

So of course I had to hack on it.

Bugger.
