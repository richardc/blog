Spent 2 hours trying to figure out why my puppet-dashboard database
snapshot from prod was causing my dev copy to explode, when I discoverd
what it actually does is just keep the raw report as YAML in a TEXT record.

TEXT is limited to 64k

So the report can/will be truncated silently to 64k.

And because it's YAML which is meant to be easier to write because it
doesn't have matching braces or anything, it's much hard to even detect the 
truncation error

  SELECT count(*) FROM reports where length(report)=65535
  5

5 too many
