The package-maintainers commandments

 Respect the host OS
 Respect the FHS
 Build in a clean environment (mach)
 Use scripts sparingly


From the hallowed pages of rpm(1)

{% highlight %}

The general form of an rpm upgrade command is

rpm {-U|--upgrade} [install-options] PACKAGE_FILE ...

This upgrades  or installs the package currently installed to a newer version.
This is the same as install, except all other version(s) of the package are
removed after the new package is installed.
