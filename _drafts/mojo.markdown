title: Getting your mojo back
---

A while ago I realised I'd misplaced my mojo.

It's taken a little longer to realise where I put it, or where to get another
one.

But it's actually simple.

Get Excited.  Do Stuff.

Getting excited is certainly a big part of it, but don't forget the Do Stuff
component. Doing stuff gets you in the mood to do more stuff. And some of that
stuff will be pretty exciting. Even if it's not then doing stuff leaves you
little time to be be bored or frustrated that you're not doing anything.


You Will Suck At First

Maybe not, maybe the first time you put your hand to something you'll discover
a natural aptitude, that you are the chosen one that the prophecy foretold of,
but probably not, not this week. Just because you know you're going to suck it
doesn't mean you shouldn't at least try it. If you sit there afraid to start
because there's a risk of failure then it can't be a success. You probably
don't want to just start in with open heart surgery, so you guys are allowed
to not get going, but anyone else - get at it.

You are allowed to start small.

You might want to set goals, add stuff to a todo list.

That doesn't really work for me, not if the goals are too lofty, or even too
rigid. You will have to be deliberate in making time, but for me 'it's
Wednesday so I must blog' doesn't work, it's more likely to work out as 'oh
it's Wednesday and I'm blogging' once you're into a rhythm.

Back when I was a coarser youth I would see people procrastinating and I'd try
and break them out of it by telling them to JFDI.


Now that I'm actually doing stuff again, I'm not really sure that it wasn't
the same mojo I had before, or it's a lesser equivalent, but it seems real
enough to be getting on with.
