It's probably a little late to stomp on the poor thing just now, but in the
last year or so a terrible word has made its mark on the technical community.

It has mindshare.

Ok, two terrible words, but mindshare you get a pass today.  Just today.

The word is devops.

You probably know it's a portmanteau of Developer and Operations, reaching
for the bold vision that you're some kind of fresh, exciting, nay /agile/
programmer who is charged with the smooth operation of things, rather than
some more terrible term like sysadmin.

See I've been a sysadmin for a few years now, before that a build engineer, and before that a programmer.  In all of those roles I've solved problems by writing a little code here and there, as all sysadmins do, so though it's interesting to see it being recognised more formally as a discipline, it also strikes me as superflous.  Systems administrators who code and  senior developers who have root have existed for as long as there were systems to have root on.

Because it's hip and happening, a lot of the tools being generated in the
newer languages and frameworks.  In the last couple of weeks I had a little
play with puppet-dashboard, and spotted a few bugs in it.  Being from a Test-Driven bent anyway I figured I'd dive into the test suite so rather than just sending (more) unsupported one-line patches to its maintainer, I could send a failing testcase and my workmanlike fixes.
