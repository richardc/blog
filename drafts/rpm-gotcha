title: 'RPM Scriptlets: A Small Gotcha'
---


rpm allows you to define multiple scriptlets (such a sickly name) that will be
invoked at various phases of the package installation. %pre and %post happen
before and after installing a package, %preun and %postun happen before and
after removing it. It's quite a useful feature but there's a small gotcha
(well it got me) which I'm going to share.

Here's the gun on the mantlepiece from rpm(1).

{% highlight text %}

The general form of an rpm upgrade command is

rpm {-U|--upgrade} [install-options] PACKAGE_FILE ...

This upgrades  or installs the package currently installed to a newer version.
This is the same as install, except all other version(s) of the package are
removed after the new package is installed.

{% endhighlight %}


And here's it going off, right in your face:

{% highlight text %}
Name: thetick
Version: 1.1
Revision: 1
Source: http://madeup.com/src/%{name}-%{version}.tar.gz

%preun
# stop the service (if running) and unregister the init script
service thetick stop || true
chkconfig --delete thetick

%post
# register the service
chkconfig --add thetick


{% endhighlight %}

An aside, that's close to all you need to write a .spec file for an rpm. It's
a lot less painful to do manually than all the magic you need to make a debian
package, based on my limited backporting experience.

Consider an upgrade of thetick-1.1-1 to thetick-1.2-1, we've got lucky with a
property of rpms that the only change we needed to make to the .spec file was
to change the Version define and add something to the Changelog. So we upgrade

{% highlight console %}
$ rpm -U thetick-1.2-1.noarch.rpm
Shutting down The Tick:                                [  OK  ]
{% endhighlight %}

OK, so we see that we stopped the service as expected in the %preun, as we
specified, so we'd best boot it back up.

{% highlight console %}
$ service thetick start
XXX real error message
{% endhighlight %}

So wait, what, we didn't do the %post scriptlet?

Being a print debugger I went back and instrumented the .spec file to echo out whose scriplets were firing, and came back with something odd:

{% highlight console %}
$ rpm -U thetick-1.2-1.noarch.rpm
XXX annotated version
{% endhighlight %}

During an upgrade, the order that the steps happen are as hinted at in the
rpm(1) manual - install new version and remove old one.
