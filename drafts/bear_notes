Bear notes:

Two imp mangle specs:
5 mans/raids: 0/61/
raids with prot warrior for thunderclap: 0/58/* threat build

Glyphs;
Maul, Survival Instincts, Frenzied Regeneration, Challenging Roar

For single target fights with important taunt switches swap out the Maul 
glyph for a Growl one.  On Deathbringer Saurfang you want to drop it so you
don't start tanking the Blood Beasts.


Rotation (w/improved mangle);

The tankspot video covers both the improved and non-improved mangle rotations
in some depth, but the distilled version of the imp mangle rotation is:

Mangle, GCD, GCD

Prioritity list for the 2nd and 3rd global cooldown is - 
Maintain lacerate stack
Reapply Demo Roar if it falls off
Faerie Fire if it's off cooldown
Swipe

Note that Faerie Fire invokes a 1-second global rather that the usual
1.5 seconds.  That means when you use FF in the rotation you'll need to
include a half second delay for maximum TPS ie:

Mangle, FF, Swipe, 0.5s wait, Mangle is more TPS than 
Mangle, FF, Swipe, Swipe, Mangle despite the dead half a second.


Boss/single target opening;

Faerie Fire, Demo Roar
Mangle, Lacerate, Lacerate
Mangle, Lacerate, Lacerate
Mangle, Lacerate, Beserk

While Beserk is up: Mangle spam, keep Lacerate up


AOE tanking;

Faerie Fire, Demo Roar
Mangle, Swipe, Swipe
Mangle, Swipe, Swipe
Mangle, Swipe, Swipe


Macros;
I macro /startattack onto many of my buttons, so even if I'm out of rage I'm
going to start building it via white damage.  I also tend to and keep Maul
queued ensuring that I don't get rage starved (very unlikely after the first
two seconds) as it'll put threat up on two targets with the Maul glyph.

A note on Demoralising Roar;
If you have a warrior with you, let them Demoralising Shout, their attack
power reduction should be greater.
If you have a retribution or protection paladin in the group they may be 
specced into Vindication which will overwrite your Demo Roar debuff as it's
a greater attack power reduction.  At this point make sure you're still
debuffing the adds, but you can stop trying to reapply it to your target.


Gearing;
No need for defense rating with 3/3 Survival of the fittest.
Defense rating does give a bit of dodge, but the other components
(block and parry rating) are wasted on you.
Raw dodge rating is pretty good, agility is better.

Until you break 40% dodge, agility is more valuable than stamina.
At 40% dodge stamina edges out agility for effective health,
and you can start to evaluate the strength and stamina items (rings, necks, 
cloaks) as they grant more stamina than the equivalent level rogue/hunter
pieces.  The strength on these items will also give you a bit more attack
power for added threat and mitigation via savage defenses, but you'll still
get most of your attack power from your weapon, so don't go overboard on
strength.

Gemming:
Meta-gem: +stamina and 3% armor value from gear.

If it's a single red, and you get more agility or stamina, stick a +20
agility in.  If not jam +30 stamina into it.

Bare in mind it might not be worth you matching bonuses even when the
socket bonus is extra stamina if it's not a red or blue socket.  For example
the 50 EoF cloak has a yellow socket with a bonus of +8 stamina.  As there
aren't any decent yellow gems for bears by matching the socket you lose 22
stamina by not socketing a +30 stamina gem.

Enchants:
Head:     AC revered (+35 stamina, some defense)
Shoulders: 10,000 Honor Stamina, or Sons of Hodir AP/Crit
Chest:    +10 stats
Legs:      LW patch (better if LW)
Boots:    +22 stamina
Bracers:  +18 stamina (+102 if LW)
Hands     +18 stamina
Back:     +22 agility (more with engineering)
Weapon:   Mongoose

Relic;
Relic-wise the EoC is better than the EoV one, as the agi will give
armor, crit, and alost as much dodge as the pure dodge on the EoV.
The EoF one, fully stacked, is better, but only just.  It's recommended
that you get yourself the cloak and 4pc T10 before you spend the EoF on it.
